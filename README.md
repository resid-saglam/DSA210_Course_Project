## YouTube Watching Habits: Analyzing Content, Time, and Location

### Description
This project analyzes my personal YouTube watch history to uncover patterns in video consumption across different categories and times of the year. The aim is to understand how my viewing habits correlate with exam weeks.

### Dataset
- **YouTube Watch History** 
- **Video Categories**

### Tools and Methods
- **Tools:**
  - Google Take out for watch_history data
  - Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, geopy)
  - Jupyter Notebook for data processing and analysis
- **Methods:**
  - Data cleaning and integration
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Visualization of trends and correlations (violin plots, heatmaps, line charts)

### Project Plan

#### Data Collection
- Exported YouTube watch history via Google Takeout

#### Data Integration
- Machine Learning models to categorize the videos

#### Analysis
- Explore patterns in video consumption across different times of day, locations, and time periods
- Investigate correlations between video watching behavior, and time

#### Visualization
- Develop visual representations like violin plots, heatmaps to illustrate insights
- Highlight trends such as the type of content watched during academic periods or at specific locations

#### Machine Learning
- ML models are used to categorize the data and make regressions to predict future

#### Conclusion and Insights
- Confirm or reject that exam dates have an effect on my viewing habbits.

#### Limitations
- Accuracy of used ML models for categorization
- Accuracy of one hot encoding performed for messure closeness to an exam week

#### Future Work
- Track next few months to check for evidence that regression was accurate
- If no correlation id found, adjust my viewing habbits

### Deliverables
- **GitHub Repository:** Publicly accessible repository containing:
  - Python scripts for data cleaning, enrichment, and analysis
  - Visualizations illustrating insights from the data
  - A detailed README.md explaining datasets, workflow, and findings
- **Final Presentation:** A summary of key insights supported by visualizations, focusing on found conclusions
